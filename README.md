## Project Description
Over the course of two semesters, our team has been working to find an accurate and non-invasive way to evaluate the risk of stroke happening overnight in patients 55 years or older.

## Purpose and Functionality
These Arduino programs control the central and peripheral devices in the alert system of our final product. The central device acts as the central processing unit to determine whether or not an alarm is warranted, and the peripheral device simulates a sensor on the arm, which sends data to the central device based on the muscle response from the nerve stimulation on the arm. Since the system is not fully implemented, we are currently sending a random number to the central device for testing.
